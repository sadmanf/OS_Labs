# Scheduler
*****
Java implementation of the following four scheduling algorithms:
* Uniprogrammed
* First In First Out
* Round Robin
* Shortest Job First

After running on the given processes, the program prints the following summary data for each algorithm:
* Finishing time (i.e., when all the processes have finished).
* CPU Utilization (i.e., percentage of time some job is running).
* I/O Utilization (i.e., percentage of time some job is blocked).
* Throughput, expressed in processes completed per hundred time units.
* Average turnaround time.
* Average waiting time.

*****
To compile the program, run the following on your terminal:
* ```javac Scheduler.java```

To run the program, run either of the following commmands:
* ```java Scheduler <input file>```
* ```java Scheduler --verbose <input file>```
